Before joining Haas, I was a post-doctoral researcher at GeorgiaTech, Scheller College of Business and obtained my Ph.D. in Management Science at the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School. My primary research interest is **designing supply chain and policy interventions that help solve real-world challenges with social and environmental impact**.

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BSc and MSc in Economics and Finance at the VU University Amsterdam and an MPhil in Management Science and Operations at the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School. I also worked for 2 years as a quantitative analyst for commodity trading. At Cambridge, I have been actively involved as a PhD representative and with initiatives like Learning Together, a programme that brings prison inmates and University students together to study alongside each other and learn about the criminal justice system and the prison journey. I am a reviewer for Management Science, Naval Research Logistics, and Production and Operations Management. <br />
